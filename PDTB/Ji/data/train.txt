['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'in particular'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process . ||| They ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program .

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| The Senate bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading . ||| The most arbitrary of these is the imposition of `` service fees , '' which will directly widen the cost spread between U.S. and foreign markets .

These include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages . In addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members , these measures could have other , far-reaching repercussions . One section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct .

It is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation . In an already low-profitmargin business , commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public , depriving the private individual of access to the markets . Another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who execute trades for them . This untried concept would expose these firms to potentially astronomical punitive damages . Faced with the virtually impossible task of supervising the execution of each trade , many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor brokers . This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers . A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity . Finally , under the bill , a number of legitimate , longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned , unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue . In other words , regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance , rather than through a normal deliberative procedure . The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client . Also precluded would be dual trading , whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account , a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets .

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment , the rest is easy , right ? ||| You just call your broker and say `` buy '' or `` sell . ''
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Dream on . ||| There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing .

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'first'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Two things to keep in mind : . ||| Not all exchanges accept every type of order
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| With a market order , an investor tells a broker to buy or sell `` at the market . '' ||| It 's like saying , `` get me in now '' or `` get me out now . ''
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in fact'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| For example , if wheat is being offered at $ 4.065 and bid at $ 4.060 , a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price . ||| that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it . ||| Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55 .
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'accordingly'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55 . ||| A limit order to sell could be entered at that price .
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| A limit order to sell could be entered at that price . ||| One risk : .
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level ||| Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in fact'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get . ||| Stop orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| While stop orders sound similar to limit orders , there is a difference : . ||| Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above In contrast , sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'in particular'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| The crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do . ||| An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $ 90 under a stock that was trading at $ 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $ 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday .
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order ||| Unlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price .
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'thus'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Unlike stop orders -- -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price . ||| If it ca n't be made at that price , it does n't get filled .
['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| However , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price , while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it . ||| As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades ||| It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better .

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| This is another timing order ||| It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment , if they think they can get a better price by waiting .
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'consequently'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| This is really two orders in one , generally for the same security or commodity , instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order ||| In a fast-moving market , it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time ||| `` On the close '' can be added to many types of orders .

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed . ||| Investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are , usually , stuck with the consequences .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'in particular'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund . ||| For any given move in the overall market , it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall .
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'by contrast'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas . ||| Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Remember , though , that beta also has important limitations . ||| Beta is only part of the risk in a stock
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Beta is only part of the risk in a stock ||| `` There is risk that is not associated with market moves , and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that . ''
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Concession', 'although'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| In particular , beta does n't measure the company - and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock . ||| That `` business '' risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Our fear was people would look just at the beta of a gold fund and say here is an investment with very low risk ||| `` In reality it 's very volatile , but the movements are not because of market movements .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night , lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs . ||| Risk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds .

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| When it comes to investing , trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded : . ||| Investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver , or the ups and downs that will occur along the way
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'in particular'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| A letter from Senator John Kerry chides us today for implying that he had `` flip-flopped '' on Manuel Noriega . ||| He correctly says he has been down on Noriega for some time , hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup .

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I 've invested in during this prosperous decade . ||| Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985 , at which point the industry , while not lighting up any Christmas trees , began a slow recovery .
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Likewise , mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was , for me , a serious investment . ||| By 1987 , these properties were in a tailspin , causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she 'd `` never seen anything like it .

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| We 've all got money to spend , some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it . ||| Bank it ?
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'in short'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| but here in Figure 2 is where I 've chosen to build for the future : personal space ; automotive pursuits ; children 's toys ; gardening equipment , bulbs and shrubs ; and finally , entertainment , perhaps the best investment of all . ||| All have paid off for me in double-digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in fact'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy Figure 5 , with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of the car 's original value . ||| According to my calculations , these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $ 22,000 on the open market , .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in fact'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers . ||| My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold , according to my conservative calculations .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| With this personal strategy firmly in place , I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage . ||| My kids ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending , although I 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it .

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| But in this case the needle has a very sharp point . ||| Though it 's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent , the fact remains that , as one wag puts it , `` anybody who can fog a mirror '' can call himself a financial planner .
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| but in effect they operate in the dark . ||| There is no effective regulation of planners , no accepted standard for admission into their ranks no way to assess their performance , no way even to know how many of them there are .

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| An admittedly limited survey by NASAA , , found that between 1986 and 1988 `` fraud and abuse '' by financial planners cost 22,000 investors $ 400 million . ||| The rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons , a compulsive gambler or two , various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy , and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in fact'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners . ||| Nobody can estimate the toll , but John Gargan , a Tampa , Fla. , planner and head of one trade group , the International Association of Registered Financial Planners , thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is `` humongous , '' far greater than that from crookery .

['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'although'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| The bad news , however , has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning . ||| The Tax Reform Act of 1986 , which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners , and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand , and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| and the pool of capital they influence is enormous . ||| A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $ 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'in fact'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult , if not impossible , to regulate . ||| Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as `` investment advisers '' -- -- have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity .

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with . ||| Mr. Schwartz , the puckish planner from Englewood , Colo. , says that allowing the business to police itself would be `` like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank .

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Over the past decade or two , , the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products , variations on products , and variations on the variations . ||| Besides term life and whole life the old standbys , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policies with persistency bonuses , policies festooned with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on .

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| First , generalize . ||| Shorn of all their riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories : so-called pure insurance , which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death , and permanent insurance , which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in addition'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| If all you want is death-benefit coverage , pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck , within limits . ||| It 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| But `` term '' means just that ||| the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else : ||| There is no free lunch , there is only marketing
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'since'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that amasses cash value . ||| The word `` death '' can not be escaped entirely by the industry , but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead .
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead . ||| The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature .
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| That is gilding the lily . ||| The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle , insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into .
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| That 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package . ||| Again , no free lunch .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'in fact'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| And in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is , in effect , paying the salesman 's commission as well ; . ||| investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years , largely because of this
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| The simplest , most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy . ||| You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing , and your cash value and dividends grow over the years .
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| One newer wrinkle , , has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons ||| the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loans , '' and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| I 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately , so I look into the broad category called universal life . ||| , it is far more flexible than straight whole life .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for example'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Hugely popular , it is far more flexible than straight whole life . ||| I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment
['Expansion', 'Expansion.List', 'and'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment ||| I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Also , some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year . ||| These are not certain , either .
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| At a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed .

['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Yes , he says , premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection . ||| If interest rates plunge , the insurer may be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'in particular'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection . ||| these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive .

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen ||| there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'in short'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| I compared one universal policy for $ 130,000 face amount from such an insurer , American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln , Neb. , with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. , which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen . ||| After one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with $ 792 , but Id get only $ 14 from the Equitable .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| The difference is magnified by time , too . ||| At age 65 , when I 'd stop paying premiums , the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $ 14,000 higher than the other , even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate .

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk ||| that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate .

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'in short'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Such concerns , however , have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street 's hottest new products . ||| Since the spring of 1985 , financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities .

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'as a result'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| This is the heyday of debt ||| `` Before the sun sets on the '80s , it seems nothing will be left unhocked . ''
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market . ||| The entry fee is affordable
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'in particular'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| The entry fee is affordable ||| Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $ 1,000
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'also'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| The trust then issues securities -- -- that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors . ||| Issues typically come with `` credit enhancements , '' such as a bank letter of credit , and thus have received high credit ratings .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'indeed'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers , while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions ||| Asset-backed securities `` are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds

['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts , such as retirement plans . ||| that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Another concern is liquidity , . ||| The secondary , or resale , market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Conjunction', 'indeed'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| That 's particularly true for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time-share loans . ||| You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'however'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| In addition , an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listings . ||| There are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities .
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Investors , for instance , may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities . ||| It is n't .
['Comparison', 'Comparison.Contrast', 'but'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities , as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received . ||| That also is n't easy .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Take the `` credit enhancements , '' which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company . ||| The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities .
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'because'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper . ||| When you buy an asset-backed issue , you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties .

['Temporal', 'Temporal.Asynchronous', 'then'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| At the very least , a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find -- that is , Treasurys . ||| That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities , as well as make it tougher to unload the latter .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Instantiation', 'for instance'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| But it could be much worse . ||| Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues .

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| If these assumptions hold , voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive , at the margin , to lean Democratic . ||| If they put a Republican into office , not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon '' to their respective constituencies .

['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'specifically'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South . ||| To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies , voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'in short'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| Finally , the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House . ||| Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress , this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts .
['Contingency', 'Contingency.Cause', 'so'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do ||| To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking , this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns .
['Expansion', 'Expansion.Restatement', 'in particular'] ||| [None, None, None] ||| This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House . ||| The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959 .
